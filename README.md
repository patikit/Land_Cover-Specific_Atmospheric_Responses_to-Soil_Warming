# Land Cover-Specific Atmospheric Responses to Soil Warming

Urban areas exhibit a complex thermal behavior, shaped by e.g. land cover heterogeneity, atmospheric processes, different soil properties and manifold anthropogenic influences. A detailed understanding of land cover-specific thermal behavior in relation to anthropogenic heat storage in the soil remains limited in current research. 
We use the PALM-4U urban microclimate model to examine how a uniform +5 K increase in soil temperature at 2.91 m depth affects surface energy fluxes and near-surface atmospheric parameters depending on land cover and sky cover.

Using as dynamic forcing WRF, we developed different scenarios for studying the sensitivity, which are: (i) the influence of a 5 K soil temperature change in the deepest soil layer (2.91 m) in conjunction with and without the implementation of the bulk cloud model (BCM), resulting in four different model runs.

All eight p3d files (including the restart files) are provided. The static driver is provided as well. The dynamic driver can be accessed via request: Patricia.Glocke@kit.edu
